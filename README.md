# 🌍 Geographical Region Statistics for Environmental Monitoring Using 2D Segment Tree

## 📘 Project Overview

This project uses a **2D Segment Tree** for efficient storage, querying, and updating of environmental data such as **temperature, humidity,** and **rainfall** across a grid-based geographical region. Designed to support real-time environmental monitoring, it provides flexible tools for dynamic data analysis. Key features include range queries, update operations, and complex threshold-based queries that make it an ideal solution for weather forecasting, pollution tracking, and disaster risk prediction.

## 🗂 Files Included

The project includes two data files:
- **`data_2022.txt`**: Environmental data for the year 2022
- **`data_2023.txt`**: Environmental data for the year 2023

The program reads data from the selected year’s file and builds a 2D Segment Tree to support operations based on this structured data.
